# WWOPW

Small 2D-Game using Python and the pygame-library.
(WWOPW = World Wide OP-Web)
The term "OP-Web" is used by german Minecraft-Players as a method to trap your opponent
inside of a Cobweb and basically making it unable for them to move at all.
The gampeplay in WWOPW is based off this mechanic.
